                        "Gaming for good" - a sentence that feels almost contradictory,
                        considering how many people think that games are a net negative
                        for humanity - but games have their good side as well! In this
                        website, I'll explain exactly how gaming can have benefits, 
                        and isn't <i>always</i> bad!
