* ### What does this project use?
 This project uses HTML for the website content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements, like animations and visual effects. Additionally, this project uses the following libraries:
 * **Bootstrap 5**: Bootstrap is a library for responsive UI that makes it easy to create layouts that work on multiple devices and screen widths.
 * **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: GSAP is a JavaScript library that helps with smooth, user-friendly animations.
 * **Charts.css**: Charts.css is a CSS library for data visualization, in the form of bar charts, column charts, scatterplots, line graphs, and so on.

These libraries are imported into our project through **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**. They fetch the code for these libraries from the web. This project uses [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)'s CDN service.
